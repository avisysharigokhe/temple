            Folklore says that he was such a great devotee of Shiva that the lord was
             really pleased with him. And once He decided to come to live in his house
              as a servant. As the servant He is said to have taken the name Ugna.
               At several places in the region, Lord Shiva is still worshipped by this
                name. It is said that the lord in form of servant had imposed a condition
                 on Vidyapati that he could not disclose his identity to anyone else or
                  else he would go away. When Vidyapati’s wife was angry at her servant
                   and started to beat him Vidyapati could not tolerate the same and asked
                    his wife not to beat Lord Shiva himself and since then the lord 
                    disappeared and never was he seen again.According to the local legend,
                     Vidyapati was an ardent devotee of Shiva. He composed several songs
                      in the form of Nacharis and Maheshbanis to please the Lord.
                      Impressed with the devotion and poetic creativity of the poet,
                       Lord Shiva came to him in a disguised form of a cowherd boy
                        called Ugna.
            </p>
            
            <p class="font-italic">
            Ugna requested the poet that as he was an orphan boy he wanted to work in
             his house as his servant. With a little hesitation, the poet assigned him
              the job of looking after his cattle. Ugna became a very charming and 
              affectionate servant to the poet within a very short period.

            <p>
              One day, Vidyapati received an invitation to participate in a royal
               function of the king of Mithila, Shivasimha. He took Ugna with him
                and they left for the king’s capital. On the way the poet became 
                very thirsty but it was a huge barren land where he saw no drops 
                of water.

            </p>
            
            <p class="font-italic">
            The helpless poet finally requested Ugna to bring some water. Ugna too
            showed his inability to bring the water and requested him to travel some 
            more distance, but Vidyapati refused to walk further and became unconscious.
             He fell on the ground. Now, Ugna, who was none but Lord Shiva himself, took
              out a jug of water from his matted hair (jata), revived him to consciousness
              d gave the poet water to drink. The poet felt the taste of Ganga-water and 
              immediately asked Ugna wherefrom he had brought it.

            </p>  
            <p class="font-italic">
            Ugna tried to make some false story but failed to do so. He wanted to keep it
            a secret and that’s why he avoided deliberately the poet’s query, but as Ugna
             wanted to avoid it, the poet’s curiosity increased. Finally, he appeared as 
             Shiva, in his original form, before the poet.
            </p>  
            <p class="font-italic">
            Vidyapati touched his feet and took the dust of Ugna’s feet into his hands.
             Ugna now warned him not to disclose the secret before anybody including the
              poet’s wife Sushila. Vidyapati assured Ugna to keep this secret with him.
            According to the local legend, Vidyapati was an ardent devotee of Shiva.
             He composed several songs in the form of Nacharis and Maheshbanis to please
              the Lord.
            </p>  
            <p class="font-italic">
            Ugna remained with Vidyapati for many years and helped him miraculously in 
            many critical situations. For instance, when Shivasimha was arrested by
             Emperor Allaudin Khilji of Delhi, Vidyapati accompanied by Ugna, came to
              Delhi to get him released. Knowing that Vidyapati was a poet, Allaudin 
              arranged a scholarly debate between Vidyapati and his own court-poet.
            </p>  
            <p class="font-italic">
            Vidyapati was told to respond either in Persian or a mixed language alone.
             The poet with the heavenly blessings of Ugna defeated the Sultan’s poet and
              responded in poetry he had composed in the prescribed languages. Not only
              that, with the blessings of Ugna he got rid of many obstacles created by the
               Sultan and his men at Delhi and finally succeeded in getting his king 
               released from the prison of Sultan.
            </p>  
            <p class="font-italic">
            Once, the wife of Vidyapati assigned some domestic responsibility to Ugna,
             which he failed to deliver according to her given instructions. She became
              angry with him and started beating him with a broom. This erratic behaviour
               of Sushila made Vidyapati frustrated that Shiva, of whom he was a great
                devotee, should be abused and humiliated. He could not control himself 
                and shouted at her to stop, and at that very moment Ugna disappeared.
                 Vidyapati realised his mistake. He left his house and wandered through
                  many temples, rivers and jungles in search of Ugna.
