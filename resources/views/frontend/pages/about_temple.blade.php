            Vidyapatidham is known worldwide as Nirvan Bhoomi of the celebrated Maithil
             poet Vidyapati (1352 – 1448 AD), He was polyglot and polytheist. 
             Though universally acclaimed for erotic compositions dedicated to the 
              love sports of Radha- Krishna, his devotional compositions dedicated to 
              Shiva- Shakti, mother Ganges and other facets of nature are par-excellence
               as his literary contributions.

            Light myriad attributes of Vidyapati his final ‘Mundane Resort’- Vidyapatidham
             is agog with many legends for its bestowing phenomenal religious and
             intellectual fervor.

            On attaining ripe age, he summoned his family member and expressed his wish
            to breath his last in the lap of Mother Ganges, likewise arrangements were 
            made. They (along with Family members) travelled all over the night and  
             reached at the place then known as Mow- Bazidpur at the dawn.

             <b> Vidyapati asked </b>: "Tell me how far the Ganges is and how far?" 
             "Thakurji, close to quarter to two Kos." his companion responded.
              After this, a great poet filled himself with confidence and told  
              "Stop and keep the palanquin here. Ganga will come here." His family
               members replied “this is not possible. Ganga is flowing at a distance 
               of about a quarter to two kos. How will it come here? You must be patient.
                Within an hour we will reach the Ghat."  Mahakavi insisted to stop there 
                only. Mahakavi said, "We don't need to go any further. The Ganges will 
                come here. If a son is coming from so far away with his old body to see
                 his mother at the last moment of life Why not Mother Ganges can come to 
                 meet her son? Ganges will come and will definitely come." Saying this, 
                 the great poet sat down in the meditation. Within few minutes, the Ganges
                  reached there with the flow of its rising stream. Everybody was surprised.
                   Mahakavi first bowed to Ganga with both hands and prayed, then entered the 
                   water and composed the following song:
            </p>
            
            <p class="font-italic">
            बड़ सुखसार पाओल तुअ तीरे। <br>
            छोड़इत निकट नयन बह नीरे।।<br>
            करनोरि बिलमओ बिमल तरंगे।<br>
            पुनि दरसन होए पुनमति गंगे।।<br>
            एक अपराध घमब मोर जानी।<br>
            परमल माए पाए तुम पानी।।<br>
            कि करब जप-तप जोग-धेआने।<br>
            जनम कृतारथ एकहि सनाने।।<br>
            भनई विद्यापति समदजों तोही।<br>

            At the time of his last breath Lord Shiva (Ugna), and Ganga appeared to
             the great poet and told- at this holy place along with you Lord Shiva
              will also stay in the form of Lingam. This place will be of a great 
              importance.
            </p>

            This is a unique temple where God and Devotee both are worshiped.

            </p>  
            
            <p class="font-italic">
            This place was under a dense forest, farmers used to take their cows and 
            other cattle for grazing in that forest. A shepherd used to bring some
             of the cows over there, out of those cows one black coloured cow used 
             to go near this holy place and flow the milk from her udder.  
             At the time of milking the owner of the cow noticed this cow is 
             not giving enough milk, he scolded the shepherd. Once the shepherd 
             noticed that this cow flows milk from her udder at the place where 
             two stones are there, he updated the same to the owner.
            </p> 

            <p class="font-italic">
            After that people of the surrounding area made a small temple and 
            started worshiping, this has resulted prosperity across them.
             Hence the belief got further stronger.
            </P> 

           <p class="font-italic">
           During British era the railway line was getting laid. As per the design the 
           railway line was crossing over this place. Railway engineers and workers
            tried to remove these two stones (Shiva Linga & Vidyapati Samadhi Linga),
             they did not succeed. The cut mark on the linga is still evident.
              Then Railway Officials modified their plan and they have given 16 Kattha 
              16 Dhoor for the temple.

            </P> 

            <p class="font-italic">
            Current building of the temple was built during nineteenth century by
             Shri Bheshdhari Choudhary of Keota.
